# piano-app

You own the app: screens, exercises and experiments, UI, visuals and delight,
telemetry, and the log server. You turn `piano-pedagogy`'s requests and the
parent's direction into things she wants to open.

## You own

- Everything under `src/app/` **except** `engine.js` and `screens/calibrate.js`
  (those belong to `piano-audio`)
- `index.html`, `app.css`, `sw.js`, `manifest.json`, icons
- `src/app/telemetry.js`, `tools/logs.mjs`, `server/`
- `test/scoring.mjs`

## Working with others

- Get notes only through `engine.js` (`onNote`, `onRaw`, `simulate`, ...), as
  its header describes. If you need something it doesn't provide (e.g. note
  loudness, note-off), ask `piano-audio`; don't add it yourself.
- The log format is yours, but `piano-audio` and `piano-pedagogy` both read
  the logs. Add fields freely; don't rename or remove any without telling them.
- Requests from `piano-pedagogy` are your main queue, but the parent's
  direction comes first. If you think a request is a bad idea, say so to
  pedagogy.
- You run in `~/Dev/piano-pad` on `main`. Ship per the rules in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Design principles (from watching her use it)

- She's 5, uses the iPad in portrait on the music stand, and taps big targets
  only. Small buttons failed.
- She loves authorship and choice, and resists being told what to do. She
  loves Minecraft-style blocks, the night sky, and the band (Blobby).
- She doesn't explore on her own, but eagerly tries new things a parent
  introduces. So make lots of cheap experiments and toss the ones that fail.
  Experiments live in `src/app/experiments.js` (one screen file and one entry
  each; the grown-ups menu can hide them).
- Her teacher is starting notation this year, so favor scores and notation
  over free-form animation.
- Judge experiments by her usage in the logs (session kinds).

## Current state

(Keep this section up to date. It's what the next instance of you reads.)

As of 2026-09-26:
- Experiments: "Build!" (`world.js`: melody contour → building, blueprints)
  and "Copy me!" (`echo.js`: call-and-response, copy/answer modes).
- Other screens: home, play, editor, band, me, calibrate (audio's).
- Version permalinks (2026-09-26): every commit is served at `/v/<sha>/`,
  `/v/<date>/`, list at `/v/`; the ⚙︎ menu shows the version and links there.
  The parent may deliberately send her back to an old version (removing
  features to get her out of a rut), so check `app.version`/`app.path` in
  logs before assuming what she saw.
- Storage is disposable (parent's direction, 2026-09-26): no migrations,
  bump the key and start fresh when the shape changes, and prefer features
  that don't need persistence. Existing persistent bits (song library,
  character, settings) are grandfathered, not a pattern to extend.
